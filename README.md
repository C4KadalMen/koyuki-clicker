# About Momoi Clicker

I honestly have no idea on how did I managed to fork Koyuki-Clicker and make it Momoi Saiba instead. As I stated before, this is a fork from Koyuki Clicker with Momoi Saiba instead of Kurosaki Koyuki. The whole resources are mostly from the game(possibly from the Blue Archive Wiki itself). Credits to the one who made Koyuki Clicker, ZeroFPS-HK.

Silly thing I made for fun. Click screen. spawn koyukis. Repeat. Most of the code is generated by ChatGPT prompts, with some manual adjustments.
